                "A bitcoin wallet is a software application that allows people to send, receive and manage their bitcoins.\nBe aware of how other bitcoin applications store your bitcoins' private keys, which are needed to spend your bitcoins.\nThere are generally three different ways applications can your store your bitcoins.\n1.\nThe banking model where your bitcoin private keys are held for you by someone else.\n2.\nThe security box model where your bitcoin private keys are stored encrypted on someone else’s servers.\n3.\nThe wallet model where your bitcoin private keys are stored only on your device.".localized,
                "ArcBit used the the bitcoin wallet model (See the section ’What is a bitcoin wallet?’ to understand the 3 different security models of bitcoin software). However if you use iCloud to back up your wallet, you will be using the security box model. It is recommended that you do not use iCloud, and be responsible for your bitcoins yourself, but for those who don’t want to remember a simple backup passphrase, iCloud backup is a good alternative.".localized,

                "After a transaction is broadcast to the Bitcoin network, it may be included in a block that is published to the network. When that happens it is said that the transaction has been mined at a depth of 1 block. With each subsequent block that is found, the number of blocks deep is increased by one. To be secure against double spending, a transaction should not be considered as confirmed until it is a certain number of blocks deep.\nA good rule of thumb is that 1 confirmations is good for small value amounts of bitcoins, and a user should wait for more confirmations for larger value amounts.\nArcBit will display the confirmation number up until the 6th confirmation.".localized,
                "An account is a collection of bitcoin addresses. With accounts, you will no longer have to manage bitcoin addresses directly anymore. Since address reuse results in a loss of privacy for people using Bitcoin, ArcBit’s HD wallet account system will automatically handle the cycling of bitcoin addresses for you, so that you don’t use the same bitcoin address more then once.\nEach account also has a reusable address. You can find it in your receive screen. Swipe all the way to right on the QRCode in your receive screen and you will find a reusable address.\nYou can create an unlimited amount of accounts with ArcBit. See the help section on how to create a new account in ArcBit.".localized,
                "Some people has compared bitcoin addresses to a bank routing number. It is a good analogy, however bitcoin addresses are public. So if you reuse the same bitcoin address for multiple payments like you would a routing number, people will be able to figure out how much bitcoins you have. Thus it is recommended that you only use one address per payment.\nThis causes usability issues because making the user use a new address whenever receiving a payment is cumbersome.\nStealth/reusable addresses provides a better solution. When you give a sender a reusable address, the sender will derive a one time regular bitcoin address from the reusable address. Then the sender will send a payment to that regular bitcoin address. Now you can give many people just one reusable address and have them all send you payments without letting other people know how much bitcoins you have.\nA reusable address looks sometime like this vJmxthatTBXibYe9aZavx18iAT9gyiJETGkhwPX2WbHQGuzX83YvQXynD2t8yHU4Xjfonu5x9m6B4yxquytFP1c2CRbVR9mecxesvE. A reusable address is a lot longer then a regular bitcoin address, it is 102 characters in length.\nReusable addresses are great, however there are no other mobile bitcoin wallets but ArcBit that supports reusable addresses for now. Which is why ArcBit support receiving payments from both regular bitcoin addresses and reusable addresses.\nFor each account, you have one reusable address. You can find it in your receive screen. Swipe all the way to right on the QRCode in your receive screen and you will find a reusable address.".localized,
